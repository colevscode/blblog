We're proud to announce our newest family of Backlift app templates launched today at [airfoil.backlift.com](http://airfoil.backlift.com). AirFoil apps provide everything you need to launch and optimise a landing page, collect email addresses, and track conversions. 

We figure it's best to show, not tell, so we created this two minute tour of AirFoil. Check it out!

We also received some great press over at Tech Crunch this morning. Thanks Frederic for the great write up, posted [here](http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/28/backlift-the-yc-backed-back-end-service-for-front-end-developers-launches-ab-testing-service/).

There's a ton of new docs up at [backlift.github.io/docs](http://backlift.github.io/docs) that go into greater detail about the new features we launched with AirFoil. And since AirFoil apps are just dressed-up Backlift apps, you can integrate these new analytics features into your existing apps today!
