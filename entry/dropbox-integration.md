Deploying a web app on [backlift.com](https://www.backlift.com) is now easier than that horse dance. Just sign in to Backlift using Dropbox, pick a template and click "create". The toughest part is choosing a name.

When you create an app, Backlift will add a new folder to your Dropbox/Apps folder containing the app's source files. Then, when you add files or make changes locally, Backlift will update the live web app. Your app will have a unique and hard to guess URL that you can keep private or share with others.

<!-- Your app will have a private URL, and the source files will be downloaded to your Dropbox folder. Any changes you make locally will be pushed to your live app, and your browser will be automatically refreshed. 

Try viewing your app's URL on a few mobile devices. Then change the source files, and watch all your devices refresh. Testing a responsive design has never been this easy.-->

Dropbox integration is one way Backlift makes life easier for front-end developers. Deploying a website today is too difficult due to the myriad front-end technologies involved in modern web development. Not to mention the back-end, which requires an entirely separate skill set. We help front-end developers focus on the important stuff: the user experience.

Backlift provides the core features that every web app needs: data persistence, access control, and file hosting. We also offer a few conveniences to speed up development, like drag-and-drop deployment via Dropbox, and automatic compilation of coffeescript and handlebars files. Finally when you're ready for production, we'll package and optimize your app. 

Please [sign in](https://backlift.com) to give Backlift a try. We think you'll agree that this is an easier, more gratifying way to build web apps. However, we've got a lot of work to do. Keep us on track by leaving comments, or sending  feedback to feedback (at) backlift.com. Thanks!
