It's 4am and I've spent the last hour responding to user feedback and thinking about the future of backlift. This startup is at an exciting phase where we are starting to hear positive user stories, and get feedback that validates our hypothesis: that we can get  that 

It makes me think of the fabled graph on the wall during my first go through YC. Could these be the wiggles of user excitement? Or are these wiggles of false hope?

Its too early to call it, but I feel really positive about backlift's prospects. It's amazing that we've made it to this point, given the constant struggle over the last 6 months to justify our existence. A pre-traction startup exists in a vacuum-- It's almost impossible to be rationally optimistic when you don't have users. You must create your own motivation and support. In my case, as a solo founder and only full time employee, that means I have to be irrationally optimistic, despite numerous discouraging facts of life: that most startups fail and that there's no evidence yet that my company is not like most startups.

If I succeed now it will only be because I was too ignorant to fail. If I fail, it won't be the first time. This is my second startup, the first failed after a year. Between the summer of 2010 and now I've failed continuously. Three failed games and about eight failed products. 

It occurs to me that though startup failure is likely a given for every entrepreneur, it's invalid advice to take that statistic as some kind of indicator of your own chances for success. I'm not suggesting that you ignore the facts or pretend that you're special. That as an individual your chances of success are much greater than any startup. Largely because people redefine success as they progress. If your goal was to start a company, but instead, after setting off on your own you only learned how hard it is to make something people want, and in the process discovered you would be much happier in another job-- that's a success story. Especially if you redirected your career towards something more fulfilling in the process. If you're the kind of ignorant founder that can't seem to recognize a pattern of failure, and as a result keep repeating the entrepreneruial mistake, perhaps you will eventually accidentally succeed. In the end humans only really fail once, so keep trying different things.
