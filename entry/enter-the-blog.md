This is the backlift blog! It is, in fact, a backlift app. Don't believe me? Check out [blog-colevscode.backliftapp.com](https://blog-colevscode.backliftapp.com). Pretty soon we'll be adding the blog to the list of templates that can be installed from the backlift Command Line Interface. 

This blog is awfully simple. Entries are created in markdown and rendered by [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked). Comments are handled by disqus. The coolest feature is that in the editor mode, a preview of the rendered markdown is updated live as you type, so you get immediate visual feedback. 

We'll be using this blog to announce new backlift features, post service status updates or planned maintenance, and highlight backlift apps that rock. Please stay tuned here We'll likely also use twitter to announce new posts, so follow [@backliftapp](http://twitter.com/backliftapp) for the latest!
