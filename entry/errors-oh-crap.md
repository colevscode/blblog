On the heels of our big upgrade, we face great anguish. One of the features that we launched this morning was the ability to bundle github projects directly into backlift templates. This means that as a new app is created, it fetches tarballs directly from github, and expands them into the new project folder before building the app. This fetch process has simply stopped working, and we're working hard to figure out why.

For all the folks out there that are excited about backlift and have come to give it a try, thanks for your patience and we apologize. I hope you come back again soon. We'll post to @backliftapp on twitter and here on our blog as news unfolds.
