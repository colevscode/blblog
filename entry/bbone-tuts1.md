A few weeks back we posted a few Backbone.js tutorials on Gun.io. Here are the links to the tutorials posted so far:

[Building Backbone.js apps with Backlift Part 1: Views and Templates](http://gun.io/blog/Building-Backbone.js-apps-with-Backlift-Views-and-Templates/)

[Building Backbone.js apps with Backlift Part 2: Collections and Forms](http://gun.io/blog/Building-Backbone.js-apps-with-Backlift-part-2-Collections-and-Forms/)

We're planning to release a third tutorial soon on user authentication and access control, but we don't have a firm date. We'll be sure to post on this blog when it's ready!
