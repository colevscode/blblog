To Paul, Quentin, Alex and the rest of the RA crew,

We're sorry. We didn't mean to step on your toes with [airfoil.io](airfoil.io). Since we've launched we've had several comments from the community pointing us to your audio streaming product. The two products are clearly quite different: ours is an A/B testing platform, which is hard to confuse with an audio product. But we don't want to be jerks.

So here's a proposal: We've changed [airfoil.io](airfoil.io) to point to a landing page that links to both products. We've moved the main airfoil.io content over to [airfoil.backlift.com](airfoil.backlift.com). We're happy to leave it this way, if you guys are cool with that. Otherwise, ping me at cole at backlift.com and we'll work it out.

Best of luck, and pardon me while I hook up a kick ass airfoil streaming setup for my apple TV.
