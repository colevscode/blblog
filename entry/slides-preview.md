We've been working on a slide presentation template that makes it easy to create an publish slides via Dropbox. It's nearly time for HTML5 DevConf, and we wanted to get out a preview for all those presenters who are, no doubt, working hard on their decks right now. So here it is!

<a target="top" href="https://www.backlift.com/backlift/dropbox/create?template=github.com/backlift/slides-template&appname=slides"><button class="btn btn-primary btn-large" style="font-size:larger;padding:5px 14px"> Get the Slides template </button></a>

{{$ break }}

And here's a preview of the Slides template in action:

The Slides template lets you create slides using HTML or Markdown, using the deck.js library. Any `.html` or `.md` files that you drop into the `/slides` folder will automatically be added to the presentation. It's all on [github](https://github.com/backlift/slides-template) so feel free to fork it or ping us with issues.
